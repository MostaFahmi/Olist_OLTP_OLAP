# Olist_OLTP_OLAP

# Overview: 
## The project was split into two parts:
## Database Developer Part:
Where I developed the ERD, and did the Mapping to have the normalized (OLTP) Database of an e-commerce company located in Brazil, Olist.. Ready for installing and updating its data.

## BI Developer Part:
Where I had my historical data from the Olist_DB to develop (OLAP) Data Warehouse/Mart.  And then do some analysis to answer some business questions, visualized in Report sheets.
